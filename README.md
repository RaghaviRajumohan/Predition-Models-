# Housing Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project aimed at predicting housing prices based on various features. The project demonstrates advanced data analysis, feature engineering, and the implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.

## Project Structure
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
  - Imported and explored the dataset using Pandas and NumPy.
  - Handled missing values through imputation techniques.
  - Performed data cleaning to remove duplicates and irrelevant features.
  - Applied feature scaling and normalization to ensure uniform data distribution.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to understand feature distributions and relationships.
  - Used visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful plots (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps).
  - Identified key features impacting housing prices.

- **Feature Engineering and Selection**
  - Created new features based on domain knowledge (e.g., age of the property, proximity to amenities).
  - Applied encoding techniques to handle categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
  - Utilized Boruta for feature selection to identify the most relevant features impacting the target variable.
  - Evaluated feature importance using techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance from tree-based models.

- **Model Building and Evaluation**
  - Split the data into training and testing sets.
  - Implemented multiple machine learning algorithms:
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Tree Regressor
    - Random Forest Regressor
    - Gradient Boosting Regressor
    - XGBoost Regressor
  - Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.
  - Evaluated models based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared score.

- **Model Deployment**
  - Saved the best-performing model using joblib for future predictions.
  - Created a user-friendly interface using Flask (or Streamlit) for users to input features and get price predictions.
  - Deployed the model to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud) for scalability and accessibility.
